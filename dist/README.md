## What I Learned

***

By creating TripTrackr, I was able to practice and advance many of my developer skills. I was able to use my knowledge of JavaScript to create all of the functionality for this web app. I continued building my skills with SASS by creating an organization system which fit the project and ensuring the design works with all commonly used screen sizes.
